# WebCLIPS

## Introduction

WebCLIPS implements a CGI interface for using [CLIPS](http://clipsrules.sf.net) through an HTTP
interface.

This is **old** code. It's Windows based and should be used only for
**reference/example** when coding your own CLIPS web interface method.

This repository is a clone of the original
[SourceForge](http://clipsinterface.sourceforge.net/WebCLIPS/wchome.htm)
project. Which in turn is a subproject of the
[CLIPS interface](http://clipsinterface.sourceforge.net/) project.
